# Customer Segmentation Project
This repo contains the Customer Segmentation project as part of my data science portfolio. The customer segmentation technique covered in this project is called RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.  RFM analysis is a behaviour-based approach of grouping customers into segments or clusters. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions i.e. how recently, how often, and how much did a customer buy. This project documents the steps to implement customer segmentation using RFM analysis in Python 3 code.

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** website. It is a transactional dataset which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retailer.
