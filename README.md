# Customer Segmentation Project
This repo contains the Python 3 code for my Customer Segmentation project using RFM analysis. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behaviour-based approach of grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions i.e. how recently, how often, and how much did a customer buy. 

## Dataset
The dataset that I am using is publicly available from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** website. It is a transactional dataset which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retailer.
